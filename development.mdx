description: 'Learn how to run SwitchFeat locally and contribute.'

<Info>
  **Prerequisite** You should have installed Node.js (version 18.10.0 or
  higher).
</Info>

The SwitchFeat has been configured as a Lerna (Nx) monorepo.

Once you cloned the repo from Github, to build the project just use the following command in the root folder of the project:

``` npm
npm run build
```

To start both the server and the ui, simply run:

``` npm
npm run start
```

SwitchFeat will be available at http://localhost:4000 

## Running frontend and backend separately

For convenience during the development phase, the [package.json](https://github.com/switchfeat-com/switchfeat/blob/main/package.json) file esposes two additional 
scripts which allow to run the server and the UI on separate ports. 
This simplifies working on the frontend, where the UI can be updated without running a full build on both projects on every change.

The following command will run the UI process on http://localhost:3000
```
npm run dev:start-ui
```

The following command will run the Server process on http://localhost:4000
```
npm run dev:start-api
```
