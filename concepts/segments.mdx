title: Segments
description: 'Segments define how a subset of users can be grouped together to share visibility on some features.'

A segment can be imagined as a container of user traits. 
If a user satisfies all or at-least-one of those conditions, they will be logically assigned to such segment.

## Segment conditions

A segment is made up of one or multiple conditions which define the structure of the segment itself.

The main property of a condition is the `context`. It is basically the user trait that need to be processed to evaluate if the current user can be assigned to the current segment.

SwitchFeat support the following set of condition types:

- **boolean**
- **string**
- **numeric**
- **datetime**

Each of those condition type have a specific set of operators that can be evaluated against the given context to assign the user to the segment.

SwitchFeat allows to configure how conditions should match in order to assign a user to the segment. There are currently two matching criteria:

- **All**: all conditions need to be satisfied.
- **Any**: at least one condition needs to be satisfied.
