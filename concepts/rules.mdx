description: 'Rules are the the way multiple segments can be assigned to a single flags.'

Even if a flag is in active state (switch turned on), if there is one or more rules assigned to such flag, 
in order to have a match from the SwitchFeat API, at least 
one rule need to be satisfied.

 
>At th curret stage, rules are extremely simple, they just allow the user to assign a segment to a flag.
Flag variants are currently under development, and will allow to add variants to a specific rule.
