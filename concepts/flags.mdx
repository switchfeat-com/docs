Creating a new flag is the first step to start using SwitchFeat. With flags it is possible to switch features on or off based on its state and or based
on additional conditions defined in rules.

An example might be, having a flag named `new-hero-banner` which can be used to gate the access to the new hero banner of you landing page only to a subset of users to a specific user in particular.

Flags have been implemented with flexibility in mind, they can be used as simple kill-switch to toggle features on/off, but they can also be attached to segmentation rules, 
to address more complex user scenarios.

While flags can be used as kill-switch to toggle features on/off, using the state switch, it is possible to define more complex scenarios using rules.
