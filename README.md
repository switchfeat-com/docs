# SwitchFeat docs

This repo contains the public docs of SwitchFeat powered by Mintlify. Any changes to the main branch of this repo are going to be automatically deployed and 
visible in the project documentation.

### 👩‍💻 Development

Install the [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the documentation changes locally. To install, use the following command

```
npm i -g mintlify
```

Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where mint.json is)

```
mintlify dev
```

### 😎 Publishing Changes

Changes will be deployed to production automatically after pushing to the default branch.

You can also preview changes using PRs, which generates a preview link of the docs.

#### Troubleshooting

- Mintlify dev isn't running - Run `mintlify install` it'll re-install dependencies.
- Page loads as a 404 - Make sure you are running in a folder with `mint.json`
