## Docker

The easiest way to start using SwitchFeat is using the pre-built Docker image. The image gets updated everytime new updates get released, which
guarantees a more stable and reliable environment to work on.

### Run the Docker image

The following command will download the image, create a new container in your local Docker instance and run it.

```
docker run 
    --name switchfeat-com \
    -d -p 4000:4000 \
    ghcr.io/switchfeat-com/switchfeat:main
```

Once the download is complete, an additional step is needed to set the environment variables within the Docker image itself. 
The image already contains a `.env.example` file which contains all the environment variables names. 
Fill the values for the variables in the required section, rename the file to `.env` and restart the container.

Once done, SwitchFeat will be available at http://localhost:4000
